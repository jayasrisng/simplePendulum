# 🎯 Simple Pendulum – Unity Physics Simulation

This Unity project simulates a simple pendulum using Rigidbody physics and configurable joints. It's meant for educational demos, physics experiments, or as a base for larger simulations.

## 🚀 Features

- Realistic pendulum movement using Unity's physics engine
- Minimal setup: works out-of-the-box
- Clean C# scripting and modular hierarchy
- Lightweight: built for fast testing or teaching

## 🛠️ Built With

- Unity 2022.3.5f1
- C#
- Rigidbody2D + Physics2D components
