# 🎯 Simple Pendulum – Unity Physics Simulation

This Unity project simulates a simple pendulum using Rigidbody physics and configurable joints. It's meant for educational demos, physics experiments, or as a base for larger simulations.

## 🚀 Features

- Realistic pendulum movement using Unity's physics engine
- Minimal setup: works out-of-the-box
- Clean C# scripting and modular hierarchy
- Lightweight: built for fast testing or teaching

## 🎥 Overview & VR Concept

Watch demo videos to get an understanding of what this project does. This project includes different scenes for single and multi-pendulum setups.

The objective of this project is to enable manipulation of a virtual pendulum in ways not possible with a real one. In VR, users can pause and play the simulation while preserving physical properties like velocity and momentum—unlike real-world pendulums, which are influenced by external conditions such as wind or drag.

The multi-pendulum demo showcases how varying pendulum lengths affect motion. This experience was designed to illustrate how simple it is to create kinetic art blueprints in VR.

Kinetic art engages viewers through motion, but physical installations are often constrained by size, material, and safety concerns. In this project, we explore how virtual reality (VR) redefines interaction with kinetic art by providing immersive environments where users can manipulate, analyze, and engage with motion-based systems beyond real-world limitations.

Using a simple VR pendulum as a case study, users can alter parameters such as speed and gravity, pause oscillations, and explore perspectives that are otherwise impossible to achieve. This shift in interaction demonstrates how behavior changes in virtual spaces, where users actively experiment instead of passively observing.

I'd like to present the concept of virtual studios - immersive environments that allow artists, scientists, and designers to safely explore physics concepts, prototype kinetic systems, and develop blueprints. These virtual creations can be directly transferred into real-world installations, bridging the gap between imagination and reality. VR studios eliminate risks associated with real-world experimentation, enabling users to explore ideas freely and intuitively.
